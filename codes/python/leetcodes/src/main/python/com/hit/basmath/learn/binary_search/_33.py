33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

def search(nums, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid

        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[mid] > target >= nums[left]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        if nums[mid] <= nums[right]:
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

    return -1
