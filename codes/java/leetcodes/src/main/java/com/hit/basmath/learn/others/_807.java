/**
 * 807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline
 * <p>
 * In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well.
 * <p>
 * At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.
 * <p>
 * What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
 * Output: 35
 * Explanation:
 * The grid is:
 * [ [3, 0, 8, 4],
 * [2, 4, 5, 7],
 * [9, 2, 6, 3],
 * [0, 3, 1, 0] ]
 * <p>
 * The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
 * The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]
 * <p>
 * The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:
 * <p>
 * gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
 * [7, 4, 7, 7],
 * [9, 4, 8, 7],
 * [3, 3, 3, 3] ]
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * <p>
 * 1 < grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50.
 * All heights grid[i][j] are in the range [0, 100].
 * All buildings in grid[i][j] occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are a 1 x 1 x grid[i][j] rectangular prism.
