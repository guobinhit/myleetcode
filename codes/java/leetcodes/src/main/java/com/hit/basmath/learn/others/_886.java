/**
 * 886. Possible Bipartition
 * <p>
 * Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size.
 * <p>
 * Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.
 * <p>
 * Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered a and b into the same group.
 * <p>
 * Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
 * Output: false
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
 * Output: false
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= N <= 2000
 * 0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000
 * 1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N
 * dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]
 * There does not exist i != j for which dislikes[i] == dislikes[j].
