/**
 * 71. Simplify Path
 * <p>
 * Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the canonical path.
 * <p>
 * In a UNIX-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period .. moves the directory up a level. For more information, see: Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix
 * <p>
 * Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash /, and there must be only a single slash / between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) must not end with a trailing /. Also, the canonical path must be the shortest string representing the absolute path.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: "/home/"
 * Output: "/home"
 * Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: "/../"
 * Output: "/"
 * Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: "/home//foo/"
 * Output: "/home/foo"
 * Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
 * <p>
 * Example 4:
 * <p>
 * Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
 * Output: "/c"
 * <p>
 * Example 5:
 * <p>
 * Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
 * Output: "/c"
 * <p>
 * Example 6:
 * <p>
 * Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
 * Output: "/a/b/c"
